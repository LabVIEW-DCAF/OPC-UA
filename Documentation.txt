In LabVIEW 2013 SP1 the Client Connection will only timeout after 5 minutes which is documented in CAR 426840.

Users are not given the option to read or write to a bytestring array in the OPC UA server or client module. This functionality is not supported as of the 2016 release of the OPC UA API and is documented as part of CAR 308742.
